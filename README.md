I am a Senior Engineer at Larsen and Toubro Limited and gained hands-on experience in full-stack web development, cloud computing, and software as a service (SaaS) product development.
In my current role, I am part of a product development team working on SaaS products and cloud services, where I have implemented cloud technologies and developed a financial web app, FixFD and a DB as a service (in-house). I have experience in creating APIs with DB and sorting logics and integrating them with frontend using NodeJS, Express.JS, EJS, jQuery, Ajax, MySQL, Nginx, and more.

During my previous organization at One24, I built high-impact features like payment systems, cart products section, OTP authentication, and searching in the component. I improved the efficiency of various sections by over 70% using React, NodeJS, and Rest APIs technologies to build an end-to-end solution for multiple vendors and customers.

Apart from my professional experience, I have completed training and certifications in Full Stack Web Development, Digital Marketing, Python, Java, and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals. I have also worked on various projects, including FixFD, NoteMate, Travelgram and an Interior Designing Website, using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js , Bootstrap, ReactJS, Redux, MongoDB, JWT, and more.
